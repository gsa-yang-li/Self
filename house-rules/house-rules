Show respect and love
  Do unto others as you would have them do unto you or What you do not wish for yourself, do not do to others
  Be respectful, each family member shall never yell or scream at the other family member
  Be a loving family member, always say "Thank you" when you are helped and "I am sorry" when you made a mistake
  No physical or language abuse within the family
Keep your commitment
  Have a plan and be proactive, get things done right in time, 
    it takes time and effort, but it won't come back and hunt you
  Once you made a commitment, be self-disciplined to keep it, no matter what, unless there are some extraordinary circumstances beyond the control of human.
  Be observant, always look at the forest before the trees
  Always show a positive attitude and never give up when fulfilling your duty.
Become a mature and holistic person
  Think critically and creatively, always asks the question of "Why", brain storm on the "How", figure out the "What",
    get info or help from "Where" and "Who", keep an eye on the timeframe "When", 
    use this framework creatively each time to find out a new way of doing thing better, cheaper and faster
  Be curious, grow your knowledge and hobby, look at every aspect of your life and find out something you are interested in,
    do not put a self-imposed intellectual limit on yourself.
  Knowledge is power, however, learn how to learn new things is even more powerful, in a sense, 
    knowledge is fish, learn how to learn is the fishing rod.
  Be truthful, authentic and confident, don't make unnatural gesture or body language
  Be articulate and communicative, always reach out to people and ask questions if you don't understand or follow
    it would make you look like stupid, rather, it says you are paying attention and working hard
  Be a good listener and show empathy
  Exercise and have strong body, strong mind will always go with a strong body.
